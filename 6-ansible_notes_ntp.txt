Working with NTP and error handling:
----------------
Checks the status of the ntp service, and if it is not found, install ntp, 
starts the service, and then confirm if the service is running.
> error handling using failed_when, ignore_errors, and when conditions.

Checks the status of the NTP service.
If found, it logs the output.
If not found (rc != 0), it continues instead of failing immediately.
Handles errors gracefully.
Uses ignore_errors: yes to prevent playbook failure during service check.
Uses ansible.builtin.fail to provide a custom error message.
Installs and starts NTP only if missing.
The when condition ensures installation happens only if the service was not found.
Verifies and displays the final service status.
Ensures NTP is running after installation.
